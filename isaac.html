        Google has faced ongoing criticism over its privacy practices, particularly regarding how it collects and uses user data. Concerns have been raised about the extent to which Google tracks users across its platforms and even outside its ecosystem through tools like Google Analytics and advertising networks. Critics argue that users are often unaware of the full scope of data collection and how that data is used for targeted advertising. Despite efforts to improve transparency and offer more privacy controls, Google has been fined multiple times by regulators in the EU and other regions for violating privacy laws and failing to obtain proper user consent.
